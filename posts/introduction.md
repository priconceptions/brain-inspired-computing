## Introduction

Disclaimer: "If the human brain were so simple that we could understand it, we would be so simple that we couldn't." - Emerson M. Pugh.

Although we create algorithms that are inspired by the functionality of how our brains work, we, by no means, claim to have even half of the understanding of how our minds actually work. Many of the theories presented in these notes are just that-- theories, which are based on experiments and previously long-held knowledge. There is much more work needed in the areas of neuroscience and cognitive science to have a thorough understanding of our minds and the work is done in these notes and in the subject of brain-inspired computing encompasses a drop in the ocean of cognitive processes and functions.
