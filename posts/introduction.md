Although we create algorithms that are inspired by the functionality of how our brains work, we, by no means, claim to have even half of the understanding of how our minds actually work. Many of the theories presented in these notes are just that-- theories, which are based on experiments and previously long-held knowledge. There is much more work needed in the areas of neuroscience and cognitive science to have a thorough understanding of our minds and these notes and the subject of brain-inspired computing encompasses a drop in the ocean of cognitive processes and functions.

Given that our knowledge of the brain is so limited, what are going to talk about in these notes and why even bother devoting so much time and effort towards this subject?

Brain-Inspired Computing is a discipline in computer science that aims to describe computational models of intelligent behavior and how they relate to brain function.

Intelligent behavior can be characterized in a number of ways. Central to these explanations is its ability to acquire, structure, and apply knowledge in any specific situation and to modify and generalize this knowledge to novel circumstances.

So, why do we have so many computational models and why do we continue to refine existing ones and create new ones? The main challenge in computer science right now is the abundance of data that is produced and available to us. The efficient storage and processing of this data are central to our understanding of the world around us. 

Our brains already do this. The evolution and flourishment of our species is a byproduct of the sophistication of our processing units. We aim to understand our brain and replicate it, or even parts of it to make computation more efficient. 

Many thinkers have proposed several ideas on how the brain might work and how to achieve this. John von Neumann first proposes an idea of this in his book The Computer and the Brain (1953).  He discusses how the brain can be viewed as a computing machine and enumerates several important differences between the brain and computers (processing speed, parallelism) and suggests directions for future research. Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts, in 1943, propose the first computational model of a neuron, the Threshold Logic Unit (TLU) or Linear Threshold Unit (TLU).. Alan Turing, inspired by an infant’s brain proposes connectionist models that now we call neural networks. In his paper “Intelligent Machinery”, Turing describes randomly connected networks of artificial neurons that learn by reinforcing successful and useful links and discarding useless ones. 

A lot of work has been done in this relatively new field of computing. Yet, we are far from truly understanding the workings of the human brain and replicating it.
