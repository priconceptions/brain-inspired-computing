# Encoding Inputs into a Neuron and Decoding the Outputs

As shown in the previous article, the input of a neuron is a stimulation-- a current value in amperes (A). Neural encoding is the process of linking stimuli to neural responses. It is to understand how different stimuli can be understood and interpreted by neurons and how these neurons might react to different stimuli.

So, how would we represent an image like the one below?

There are different ways of seeing how neurons might interpret the image above.

# Rate Encoding
Rate encoding means that the frequency of neuronal firing increases in direct proportion to the intensity of the stimulus. So, with the image above, a rate encoding would be as follows:
